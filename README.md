# Todo list app - React Hooks

## General info

UPDATE: The new version uses the `useReducer` hook to manage the state of the application and the actions: add a task, delete a task, and mark and unmark a task done.

This is a training repo to practice the React Hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) and `localStorage`, to store the tasks.
Also to learn how to use linters, in this case, ESlint and Prettier.
